Set the initial configuration for the terminal, neovim and tmux in a linux environment. All the configurations are (tiny) modifications of the amazing tutorials of [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev).

It should install/set:
- [ncourse](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses/)
- [zsh](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zsh/)
- [nerd fonts/Hack](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
- [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- [zsh syntax highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
- [zsh auto-suggestion](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

Together with many plugins for nvim.

To install just run:
```bash install_initial_configurations.sh```

Select the options prefered, when asked, and type "exit" after the "oh my zsh" configuration and after the "powerlevel10k" configuration.
