Set the initial configuration for the terminal, neovim, and tmux in a Linux environment.

All the configurations are (tiny) modifications of the configurations presented in the AMAZING tutorials of [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev).

It should install/set:
- [Starship](https://starship.rs)
- [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

Together with many plugins for nvim.

To install everything just run:

```bash install_initial_configurations.sh```

When asked, select the preferred options and type "exit" after the "oh my zsh" and "powerlevel10k" configurations.
