Set the initial configuration for the terminal, neovim, and tmux in a Linux environment.

All the configurations are (tiny) modifications of the configurations presented in the AMAZING tutorials of [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev).

It should install/set:
- [Starship](https://starship.rs)
- [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

Together with many plugins for nvim and tmux.

To install everything just run:

```bash install_initial_configurations.sh```
